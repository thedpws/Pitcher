## Working with virtual environments

[Virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) keep environment variables and paths consistent across machines. In practice,

### Setting up dependencies
* To create the virtual environment, `cd` into the project directory and `python3 -m venv env`
* To install dependencies to the virtual environment, `source env/bin/activate && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Working on the project
* Before working, activate the environment by `source env/bin/activate`
* Deactivate by `deactivate`
